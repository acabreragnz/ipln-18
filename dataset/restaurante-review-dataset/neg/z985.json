  "fuimos con groupon!!!!un desaste era un tapeo y estaba re calentado!!!!habia un show d flamenco bueno!!!!no volveria jamas!!!!!", 
  "Not a great place for Flamenco in Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\nThe food (tapas) is anything else but tapas. It's more like a cheap Argentinean style appetizers. The place is hot. Watch out if you make a reservation since you can get some the tables located in front of the kitchen with a bad access to the show. Not recommended. \r\n\r\nTry other places like Bar Avila or Cantares instead for great food and Flamenco."
