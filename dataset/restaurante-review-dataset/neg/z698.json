  "I've been to several italian restaurants in south america and none even come close to even a mediocre italian place back home. First off, the lasagna was burnt and the red sauce had absolutely no spice added. To add insult to injury, the pastry part of the cannoli was burnt. The menus are stained and the place is pretty shabby. I thought many argentines come from an italian background, what happened?"
